<P>Solitaire has two scoring systems--Standard and Vegas. You select the system you want from the Options dialog box. You can also turn scoring off. Changing the scoring option in the middle of a game ends that game and deals a new one. </P>

<P>In Standard scoring, you earn points based on time and the moves you make. A bonus is awarded when you complete a timed game--the shorter the game, the larger the bonus. You can turn timing off. </P>

<P>Standard scoring awards the following:</P>

<P>In Vegas scoring, your ante is 52 dollars to begin playing each game. The object is to earn more than you have wagered. There is no time penalty or bonus awarded with Vegas scoring. If you select the Keep Score option in the Options dialog box, you can keep a running total of your score from game to game. </P>

<P>To return your score to 52 dollars, select the None or Standard option in the Options dialog box, and then press ENTER. Then reselect the Vegas option, and press ENTER. </P>
